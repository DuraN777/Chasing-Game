# Chaser Game Demo

## I made this with practicing eventListeners in mind.

In this game demo you chase another character by using keyboard arrows to move (up, down, left, right). 
That character will move randomly every two seconds. 
There is also a score to keep tabs on the amount of times a player managed to catch the runner, which doesnt make much sense since there is no end to the game, but there it is.

The code leaves much to be desired.
The math to keep character randomly placed inside the window height and width probably won't work perfectly in diverse screens.
Logic could be refactored to look sleeker and easier to read.
At the end of the excercise I find myself more familiar with event listeners and html properties such as innerWidth and innerHeight(also experimented with outerWidth / outerHeight and clientWidth/clientHeight).
